# Java Programs â€“ OOP & Advanced Topics

This repository contains a collection of **Java programs** focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **Advanced Java topics**.  
It is designed to serve as a reference for learning, practice, and revision.

## ðŸ“Œ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain both **data** and **methods**.  
The four main principles of OOP are:

1. **Encapsulation** â†’ Wrapping variables and methods together in a single unit (class).  
2. **Inheritance** â†’ Reusing properties and methods of one class in another.  
3. **Polymorphism** â†’ Ability of a method or object to take many forms (method overloading & overriding).  
4. **Abstraction** â†’ Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.

### âœ… Topics Covered
- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors (Default, Parameterized, Overloading, Chaining)  
- `this` Keyword (differentiating variables, method chaining)  
- Method Overloading & Overriding  
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical)  
- Abstraction (Abstract classes, Interfaces)  
- Polymorphism (Compile-time & Runtime)  
- Encapsulation with Getters and Setters

## ðŸ“Œ Advanced Java Topics
These programs go beyond OOP basics and explore advanced features of Java:

- **Constructor Chaining** (`this()` and `super()`)  
- **Method Chaining** (returning `this`)  
- **Collections Framework** (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.)  
- **Exception Handling**  
- **Multithreading** (Thread class, Runnable interface, synchronization)  
- **File Handling** (read/write files in Java)  
- **Streams & Lambda Expressions**  
- **Generics** (type-safe classes and methods)
